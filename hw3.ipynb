One Hot Encoding is used to transform categorical data into numerical data to be used for modelling. There are two options for encoding, OrdinalEncoding or OneHotEncoding. The problem with OrdinalEncoding is that it assigns numerical values but they in turn convery some relationship between them. For instance workclass if we encoded private to be 1, and self-employed inc was encoded to be 2 that would imply that private is less than self-employed inc, but that relationship doesn't exist.

    "1. Test data should only be used for testing purposes. If we call fit_transform on test data then it would calculate our mean and standard deviation from the test_data and then scale based on those values. We need to separate our training and testing data, call fit on the training data and transform on the testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Golden Rule states that the test data must not influence any part of he training. This is done to ensure that test data is separate from the training data when training the model. By having the two mix our test data would be no different from training data and our model would look more accurate simply because it was trained on test data. It would be like assessing a students performance on an exam but for practice they had access to some exam questions. Their results wouldn't reflect their exam performance. It wouldn't necessarily give us a worst classifier, but it would make our model appear better than it actually is.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. One advantage of sklearn pipelines is simplifying the code. By combining preprocessing and modeling we can the methods once. This minimizes the chance for errors by minimizing how many lines of code are written. Another advantage of sklearn pipelines is preventing data leakage. For instance, if we are crossvalidating, it ensures that our scalars don't accidentally \"see\" all the data in an earlier line of code before we created our folds and split training and testing data. By preventing this we ensure the integrity of our test date from our training date. \n",
