    "In this dataset, we have different types of features: numeric features, an ordinal feature, categorical features, and a binary feature. We want to apply different transformations on different columns and therefore we need a column transformer. First, we'll define different transformations on different types of features and then will create a `scikit-learn`'s `ColumnTransformer` using `make_column_transformer`. For example, the code below creates a `numeric_transformer` for numeric features. "
